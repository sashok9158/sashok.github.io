# Calsol - UC Berkeley Solar Racing Team

As one of two Solar Project Managers, I lead a 20+ member team responsible for the assembly and integration of the vehicle's solar array. 

## Solar Array

The solar array is composed of 3 subarrays, made of 5-6 modules. There are 10 distinct module designs, each of which have ~20 solar cells. We coordinate with vendors for custom cell encapsulation, using our wiring diagrams to define precise positive and negative terminal locations for each module. The subarrays are outlines in red, green and blue in the diagram below.

The diagram also includes pink lines, representing the bypass diodes. These are strategically placed to ensure that if a section of the array is shaded, breaking the primary circuit, the diode completes a path, allowing the rest of the array to continue collecting energy.

I coordinate the integration of each subarray into the battery system via MPPTs. These are DC-DC converters that match the panel's output to the battery needs in order to get the maximal amount of energy regardless of changing factors like sunlight, temperature and load changes by finding the maximum power point of voltage/current. I work directly with the electrical and mechanical teams to ensure all cross-functional requirements, such as mounting points and thermal management, are met.

**Design Optimization**

A core part of my technical contributions has been in using ANSYS and SOLIDWORKS to optimize the layout of the ribs and top shell lightening holes. The challenge was to minimize top shell weight while maintaining structural integrity of the top shell and leaving enough area for array attatchment. My simulations allowed us to reduce unnecessary mass within these constraints

## Array Integration

A major focus of my leadership this Fall is preparing the team for the Spring integration phase through rigorous documentation and training.

I coodinate training for the subteam in hardware skills, including cutting the top shell lightening holes, soldering bypass diodes, and sealing the array. I am arranging a small scale array integration practice with leftover sections of the top shell and extra solar cells, so everyone gets a feel for how it should be.
